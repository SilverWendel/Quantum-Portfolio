Quantum Computing Mini Portfolio

My name is Wendel and I'm a student about quantum computing with qiskit.
This repository contains a collection of simple quantum computing projects designed to demonstrate my skills in:

- Qiskit (circuit building + simulation)
- Quantum gates and entanglement
- Measurement analysis
- Python
- Visualization of quantum states, circuits and measurement results

-----

## Projects Included

#1- Bell States:
Creation, simulation and visualization of all 4 bell states   
Includes circuit diagrams, visualization of state vector, and an explanation of how entanglement appears.

See: BellStates.ipynb

#2- Quantum Teleportation:
Step-by-step implementation of quantum teleportation of a state from one local to another.

See: QuantumTeleportation.ipynb
