This project demonstrates how to construct and simulate the four Bell states using Qiskit.  
What include:

#  |φ+⟩ = 1/√2(|00⟩ + |11⟩)
#  |φ-⟩ = 1/√2(|00⟩ - |11⟩)
#  |ψ+⟩ = 1/√2(|01⟩ + |10⟩)
#  |ψ-⟩ = 1/√2(|01⟩ - |10⟩)

The goal is to show:
- how entanglement is created,
- how the circuits are built,
- how measurement probabilities can be drawn
- how to simulate the entaglement

-----

What This Project Covers:
- Creating Bell States in the simplest way
- How to comprove if the entanglement is working
- Creating a state vector to see the matematical form of our Bell States
