This project is a step-by-step of how to teleportate the infortation(as a state of a qubit) of one local to another

The goal is to show:
- how entanglement and bell states can be used in real quantum computing
- how to transfer information
- how to simulate and visualizate the results
-how to comprove if teleportation was successful

-----

What This Project Covers:
- Alice’s operations
- Bob's conditional corrections
- Final state verification
